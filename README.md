Data Visualization using Plotly.js 
I created this page to test how to create charts using plotly. I was challenged to try this when a student approached me for help with creating charts using plotly. This is my first attempt at using plotly.
## Types of charts
The default chart displayed is a multiple line chart for different sectors. You can select various sectors to view the chart for that sector. There are two types of charts you can view- line chart and a scatter chart.
## Future Works
I intend to convert this to a react app in future with a live API feed
